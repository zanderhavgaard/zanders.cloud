### Zander Havgaard

- I'm currently hacking @ [green.ai](https://green.ai) in Copenhagen 🌇

- I do a bit of everything within software development and operations, my main interests include:
  - Cloud Native
  - DevOps
  - CI/CD
  - Running _everthing_ in Kubernetes
  - Development: python, golang, rust
  - Operations, observability, Linux system administration

- I'm a big fan of FOSS, Linux, tiling WMs and NeoVim ❤️

- I'm active in the meetup scene, and I help organize CNCF meetups in Copenhagen. If you see me, please come and say hi, I'd love chat! 👋

- On GitHub I am [@zanderhavgaard](https://github.com/zanderhavgaard)

#### Getting in touch

I have a profile on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/zanderhavgaard), though I rarely look at it, feel free to contact me, but don't expect a quick answer.

#### Fun facts:

- I name all of my computers after spaceships, real and fictional 🛸

- I run Arch linux (btw) 🐧

- This website is hosted on my pet Kubernetes cluster running Talos Linux!

- On my own time I like obsessing over my dotfiles and NeoVim configuration, trying to brew the perfect cup of filter coffee, building and collecting (mechanical) keyboards, DnD, cyberpunk (the genre), cyberpunk (the pen and paper RPG), and much more 🎲
